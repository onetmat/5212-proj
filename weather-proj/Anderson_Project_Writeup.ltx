\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
For most of the late 20th century, the United States led the world in corn
production\cite{cornstat} with Iowa providing a
large contribution toward annual yield\cite{cornbelt}.
Although many factors can affect agricultural yield over a given season, the
weather plays a crucial role\cite{EPA}.
A reduction in year over year corn yield can be expected given flood or drought
conditions during the planting season (April-May)\cite{tradecorn}.
``Ideal'' weather conditions should therefore be easily recognizable assuming
optimal soil conditions and appropriate land management (pesticides, etc).
My project therefore seeks to relate observed weather conditions to effects on
end year corn yields using monthly corn prices as a proxy for year end yield.
\subsection{Inspiration and Precedent}
Having learned about \emph{Adaline} circuits during a conversation with a
co-worker, I began to read the works of Bernard Widrow and subsequently stumbled
onto a paper by Dr. Hu regarding neural networks and weather.
Dr. Hu performed an experiment using multiple Adaline circuits, colloquially termed
\emph{Madaline}, and observed weather data from multiple weather stations
covering a ``large'' area to predict rainfall in the San Francisco Bay area
\cite{hu}.
The detailed description of the work and high degree of accuracy spawned a great
deal of attention for using Neural Networks (NN) to predict the weather.
While the algorithms behind NNs have evolved over time, their use as a predictor
of weather remains popular \cite{litrev1} and continues to maintain accuracy
on par with other, modern prediction methods \cite{nnweather}. \\

Considerably precedent aside, the articles reviewed for this project predicted
\emph{year end yield} of various crops based on weather observations\cite{laxmi,
germany,tangerines}.
Each of the implementation specific articles performed some sort of attribute
subset selection and feature reduction.
Average rainfall, humidity, and temperature were popular choices\cite{laxmi, 
tangerines} although the time scales different from monthly averages
\cite{tangerines} to daily observations (including one morning specific value)
\cite{laxmi}.
Where humidity was not directly used, daily mean dewpoint was substituted
\cite{germany}.
The authors of \cite{laxmi} described a fairly rigorous preprocessing system
that yielded their feature subset.
In another case, the feature subset was determined experimentally by various
NN architectures\cite{tangerines}.
In each case, the output of the NN was intended to be a prediction of the yield
of a specific crop or set of crops for a pre-defined region. \\

The algorithm of choice for using NNs to predict the weather is Backpropagation
(BP).
The literature review demonstrates use of various alternatives to the core BP
algorithm (Conjuage-Gradient method, Levenberg-Marquardt) in addition to
considerable variation in architecture itself\cite{laxmi,germany,tangerines}.
My review of the articles indicates that the performance of BP using weather data
as a predictor relies chiefly on the amount of input features and the area covered.
Attempting to predict crop yields across large climate zones yielded impressive
results, as measured by Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)\cite{laxmi,germany}.
In contrast, measuring the yield of one particular crop over a smaller area
resulted in a higher error rate\cite{tangerines}.
I found this relation curious since the authors used similar
feature subsets despite considerable variance in their justification of use:
\begin{itemize}
\item Temperature
\item Precipitation
\item Ambient moisture (humidity or dewpoint)
\end{itemize}
