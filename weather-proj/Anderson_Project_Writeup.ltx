% Used various BP algorithms to produce NN predictor of crop yields
% for Rice, Wheat, and Sugarcane using a variety of weather data.
% Able to achieve single digit Mean Absolute Percent Error.
% Weather data covered entire ``zones''.
% Authors assume technological factors linearly increase yield
% over time.
% Used Min/Max temp, rainfall, morning relative humidity for 
% input variables. Sent through a farily rigorous preprocessing system. 
% Used NN models with one and two hidden layers, convoluted with 4, 5, and
% 6 hidden neurons per hidden layer.
% Hyperbolic tangent used as hidden neuron activation function.
% Assumed tanh for output layer
