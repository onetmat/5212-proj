Hi

% How to make nice horizontal line:

there

% Good reference for when structure needs to arrive.

% Biblio with rough summaries:
% ``Trading Corn Futures'', Website, www.tradertech.com/trading/corn.
% Last accessed on 5 May, 2015.
% Stuff:
% Brief overview of corn futures trading; why would anyone care? Basic
% terminology, hints of the weather affecting yield.
% ``...especially subject to yield losses from hot, dry conidtions
% during [April-May] ...''
% Emphasizes relation between yield and price.

% Another literature review highlighting the success of using ANNs
% for prediction of crop yield using weather as a predictor.

%Weather based forecasting model for crops yield using neural network
%approach
%Ratna Raj Laxmi1
%and Amrender Kumar2
% Used various BP algorithms to produce NN predictor of crop yields
% for Rice, Wheat, and Sugarcane using a variety of weather data.
% Able to achieve single digit Mean Absolute Percent Error.
% Weather data covered entire ``zones''.
% Authors assume technological factors linearly increase yield
% over time.
% Used Min/Max temp, rainfall, morning relative humidity for 
% input variables. Sent through a farily rigorous preprocessing system. 
% Used NN models with one and two hidden layers, convoluted with 4, 5, and
% 6 hidden neurons per hidden layer.
% Hyperbolic tangent used as hidden neuron activation function.
% Assumed tanh for output layer

% Input variables:
% Daily mean and max temp.
% Daily mean dewpoint
% Precipitation (assumed daily)
% Four layer backprop network, used logistic activation function.
% (hyperbolic tangent)
% Used ``identity'' activation function for output layer.
% See table two for overview of architecture.

%% All sources tie weather to crop yield, very strong basis for success
% w/r/t my project.
% It appears I go out on a limb using monthly prices as output values.
% Tang. Yield goes as far as trying to use quantized weather information
% (avg monthly rainfall, avg monthly temp, avg monthly relative humidity)
% of the primary tangerine producing regions in China to predict end of
% year crop yield.
% Multiple Neural Network configurations are used to determine ideal
% input factors and hidden neuron count.
% The paper seems to focus on determining ideal neuron count and input
% feature.
% No direct reference to activation functions was found.
