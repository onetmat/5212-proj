Regarding input data processing:
0) Need a script that will determine which weather station index
is being examined (can be as easy as int -> string).
1) Need a script that can isolate and remove the dailysummary portion
of output JSON.
   * See json_notes
2) Script must store isolated dailysummary into { int -> string } index
of weather stations.
   a) Sorted by date
   b) Not necessary for sort index to be date.
      *) Dates will be the same for each weather station
      *) {date -> int} mapping?
3) Need method of iterating over all dates in the year.

One data is sorted into appropriate mappings, need to categorize the
input data.
Think about proper mappings.

What is the best method to get weather station data?

Which weather stations to use?
   Note that we can just start downloading and processing data from any
   weather station that provides it and select later.
   Any processed weather station data can be stored in a database for later
   use or non-use.
   Storing dailysummary data may get big but could be compressed.
