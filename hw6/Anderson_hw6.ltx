1. For this homework, I intend to use weather data for all cities
providing data to Weather Underground in IA to 

2. See Anderson\_hw6\_p2.m, hw6\_train\_gen.m, and msa\_voronoi\_quant.m
for my solution.
The main script (Anderson\_hw6\_p2.m) will produce a figure that proves
the training data matches the problem statement and one figure of
classification output for various centroid counts.
Higher centroid counts improve classification accuracy,
higher training iterations.
