1. For this homework, I will use weather data for five cities in Iowa
and train a neural network using backpropagation.
The date range of my weather data spans from April 1985 to December 1999.
My output data will be historical monthly corn prices as measured in
US\$ according to http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=corn\&months=360.
The output quantization will be the delta of the monthly price normalized
to $[-0.8, 0.8]$.
The five cities selected as ``weather stations'' are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Algona
\item Ames
\item Atlantic
\item Audubon
\item Boone
\end{itemize}
These cities were chosen primarily because of data availability and
their approximate geographic locations.
My project will have additional cities and a map showing locations of each.

For each day in each month, the daily summary of weather data, as provided
by the Weather Underground (www.wunderground.com), classified the average
pressure, temperature, and total rainfall according to the following
``buckets'':
\begin{itemize}
\item Pressure (in inHg): $[29.4, 29.5, 29.6, 29.7, 29.8, 29.9, 30, 30.1,
30.2, 30.3, 30.4, 30.5]$
\item Temperature (in $^{\circ}F$): $[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110]$
\item Precipitation (in inches): $[0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2,
2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3]$
\end{itemize}
Note that any values in excess of the highest bucket or less than the value
of the lowest bucket will result in a quantization of 0 or 12.
No scientific rationale for these buckets exist, they were chosen to match
http://omahanebraskawx.com/wxbarodetail.php.\\

The network itself consists of 5 hidden neurons with one output neuron.
Each neuron will have 461 inputs, representing 31 samples of 3 data features
for each of the 5 cities.

2. See Anderson\_hw6\_p2.m, hw6\_train\_gen.m, and msa\_voronoi\_quant.m
for my solution.
The main script (Anderson\_hw6\_p2.m) will produce a figure that proves
the training data matches the problem statement and one figure of
classification output for various centroid counts.
Higher centroid counts improve classification accuracy,
higher training iterations.
